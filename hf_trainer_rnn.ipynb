Note that here the embeddings are initialized randomly and learned along with other model weights. In real-world applications, the embeddings would typically be initialized with previously learned weights.\n",
        "* Second, the embedded inputs are passed through an RNN ([torch.nn.RNN.html](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.RNN.html)), which produces a series of outputs ($(y_1, \\ldots, y_n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input) and the final hidden state $h_n$. Here, we will only use the last output $y_n$.\n",
